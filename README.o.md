# 🧠 sANNd: A Sandbox for Neural Network Discovery

**sANNd** (sandbox Artificial Neural Network development) is more than just a machine learning framework—it's an open playground designed to encourage exploration, experimentation, and creativity in neural network research.

Where traditional frameworks lock you into predefined patterns and rigid workflows, sANNd opens the gate to a sandbox where you bring your own tools, ideas, and "toys." Here, *you* define the flow of data, the structure of the phases, and the nature of the transformations.

## 🏗️ Why sANNd Exists

Machine learning research thrives on curiosity. Tweaking, bending, and breaking systems to see what happens is part of the process. sANNd exists to support that spirit of play and invention by providing:

- 🧩 **Basic and adaptable building blocks** that are easy to modify, extend, and combine.
- 🔄 **Composable phases** that form flexible, flowing networks.
- 🧰 **User-defined behaviors**, with full control over how data transforms through each stage.
- 🪁 **A minimal core** that stays out of your way while amplifying your ideas.

## 🧱 The Modulator: The Core of the Playground

At the heart of sANNd is the **Modulator**, a simple but powerful abstraction. Each Modulator accepts data and an optional function. That's it. But from this simplicity arises endless possibility:

- Stack Modulators into chains that feel like neurons.
- Transform iterables lazily and expressively.
- Pass outputs seamlessly into the next link in your network.

The Modulator doesn’t tell you how to build your network—it simply *enables* you to build the network you want.

## 🚀 Beyond sANNd

sANNd is just the beginning. It's the fertile ground from which larger, more complex systems can grow. Future projects will take these foundational ideas and expand them into architectures for discovery, automation, and dynamic computation.

But it all starts here—in the sandbox, with your hands in the sand, crafting something new.
